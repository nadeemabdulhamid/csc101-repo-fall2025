# Write the Question! 
> ## *Linux/CLI Edition*

Weâ€™re preparing for an in-class Jeopardy-style game â€” and you get to help create the content! Your task is to write Jeopardy-style questions in response to "answers" I provide below. In class, weâ€™ll use your submissions to put together and play a game.

## âœ… How It Works

Below are a list of "answers" â€” these are the Jeopardy-style clues related to Linux and command-line interfaces. Youâ€™ll submit the matching questions in the Jeopardy format:

- *What command is used toâ€¦?*
- *What does the cd command do?*
- *What is a shell?*

Your question should be technically correct, clear, and concise â€” and ideally something your classmates could get right during the game. They should be neither too vague nor overly specific, but it is ok to make them a bit cryptic.

## ðŸ§¾ Instructions
- Review the list of Jeopardy "answers" provided below.
- **Pick any 5 (FIVE)** from each category - so you have 25 answers to work on.
- For each answer, write a corresponding question in proper Jeopardy format.
- Create an Excel spreadsheet file with two columns - "answer" and "question". Fill in your selected answers and questions (25 rows) and submit your file on Canvas when you are done.

You may use any resources (books, websites, tools, including gen AI) to research and come up with your responses.

## ðŸ“Œ Example
Given Answer:
> `ls`

Your Question:
> "What command is used to list the contents of a directory?"
